# schittscreek-api

You will be building the front-end for your API site, providing documentation for using the API you will be building.

PART TWO
I will be following these steps when grading your exercise:

Clone the repo, checkout your part-two-answer branch
Run npm install all required packages should be installed
Create a new database using the name in your config with CREATE DATABASE <name>;
Create a .env file that matches your .env-sample file with the appropriate values for my machine
Run npm run lint, no errors should be reported
Run npm test, all tests should pass
Run npm run dev, all necessary migrations should run and the server should spin up and be listening without error
I will then exercise every route documented in your front-end, as shown in your documentation, all routes should work as expected
Finally, I will review your code for readability and cleanliness
